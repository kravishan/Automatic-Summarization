# Project 29: Automatic Summarization 2

This repository features a React web application and a Python server designed to create a text summarizer with an extensive array of summarization methods. The `Answers-Colab.ipynb` is our interactive Google Colab document that provides solutions to all questions up to question number 8. For a live demonstration of our summarizer tackling question number 9, we have crafted a specialized web application.

This video guide covers the entire process, from starting the Python Flask server using `python3 app.py`, to initiating the React frontend server with `npm start`. It also provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to enter a paragraph for summarization, showcasing the various summaries generated by our algorithms as well as the 'golden summary' crafted by ChatGPT.

## Features

* Introduction to NLP
* Text preprocessing
* Tokenization
* Lemmatization
* Part-of-speech tagging
* Dependency parsing
* Named entity recognition

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher is installed.
- Node.js and npm are installed.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kravishan/Automatic-Summarization.git
cd Automatic-Summarization
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv autosumvenv
source autosumvenv/bin/activate
```

3. Upgrade pip and install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the necessary NLTK and spaCy data:
```bash
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_md
python3 -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

5. Add your OpenAI API key:
- Rename `.env_sample` file in client folder to `.env`.
- Replace `your_openai_api_key` string to your openai API key which you can download from  https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.

6. Start the API server:
```bash
cd server
python app.py
```

7. Start the React web app:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

Please make sure to replace `autosumvenv` with `venv` or vice versa so that the name of the virtual environment is consistent throughout your documentation. If you use `autosumvenv`, make sure it's the same in both the creation and activation steps.

Also, ensure that you replace the placeholder text for the API key with actual instructions if necessary.
