# Project 29: Automatic Summarization 2

This repository features a React web application and a Python server designed to create a text summarizer with an extensive array of summarization methods. The `Answers-Colab.ipynb` is our interactive Google Colab document that provides solutions to all questions up to question number 8. For a live demonstration of our summarizer tackling question number 9, we have crafted a specialized web application.

## Demonstration Video

For a comprehensive demonstration of the application setup and usage, watch our demo video on YouTube: [https://youtu.be/bewVOYbnSx4](https://youtu.be/bewVOYbnSx4)

This video guide covers the entire process, from starting the Python Flask server using `python3 app.py`, to initiating the React frontend server with `npm start`. It also provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to enter a paragraph for summarization, showcasing the various summaries generated by our algorithms as well as the 'golden summary' crafted by ChatGPT.

## Live Demo

A live demo of the Automatic Summarization application is available at the following URL: [https://project-29-automatic-summarization-2.vercel.app/](https://project-29-automatic-summarization-2.vercel.app/).

### Accessing the Live Demo

If you encounter any issues with mixed content blocking in your browser (i.e., the application is served over HTTPS, but it's trying to access an HTTP resource), you may need to adjust your browser settings to allow insecure content temporarily. Here's how to do it in Google Chrome:

1. Click on the padlock icon to the left of the URL bar.
2. Select "Site settings" from the dropdown menu.

3. Scroll down to the "Insecure content" section and change from "Block (default)" to "Allow".

**Warning**: Allowing insecure content can pose a security risk. Be sure to switch the setting back to "Block (default)" after you're done with the demonstration.

### Trying Out the Summarizer

To test the text summarization functionality, you can use the following paragraph:

```text
The worldwide spread of the Coronavirus pandemic and its huge impact challenged medical and research communities to explore novel approaches for medical diagnosis from medical imaging. However, the availability of training samples makes it difficult to implement efficient deep learning AI-based solutions. In this regard, we propose new data augmentation strategies to compensate for this limitation. Our approach uses noise estimation to preserve the noise/signal ratio of the original images, while performing data augmentation. A pre-trained image Denoising Deep Neural Network (DnCNN) is used to calculate various sets of augmented images. [...] Experimental results showed the efficiency of our data augmentation approach which is comparable to the state-of-the-art augmentation methods. The results also demonstrate the potential of interpretable models like LIME to bring further insights into the data augmentation field, which provides valuable ingredients to our future research.
```

Simply paste this paragraph into the input field and click the button to see the summarization in action.

Enjoy the demonstration, and please provide any feedback you might have regarding the application's functionality and user experience.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher is installed.
- Node.js and npm are installed.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kravishan/Automatic-Summarization.git
cd Automatic-Summarization
```

2. Install virtualenv (if itâ€™s not installed): 
```bash
pip install virtualenv
```
Then, create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python3 -m venv autosumvenv
source autosumvenv/bin/activate
```


3. Upgrade pip and install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the necessary NLTK and spaCy data:
```bash
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_md
python3 -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

5. Add your OpenAI API key:
- Rename `.env_sample` file in client folder to `.env`.
- Replace `your_openai_api_key` string to your openai API key which you can download from  https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys.

6. Start the API server:
```bash
cd server
python app.py
```

7. Start the React web app:
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

## Screenshots

```

Please make sure to replace `autosumvenv` with `venv` or vice versa so that the name of the virtual environment is consistent throughout your documentation. If you use `autosumvenv`, make sure it's the same in both the creation and activation steps.

Also, ensure that you replace the placeholder text for the API key with actual instructions if necessary.
