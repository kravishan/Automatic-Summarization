# Project 29: Automatic Summarization 2

This repository features a React web application and a Python server designed to create a text summarizer with an extensive array of summarization methods. The `Answers-Colab.ipynb` is our interactive Google Colab document that provides solutions to all questions up to question number 8. For a live demonstration of our summarizer tackling question number 9, we have crafted a specialized web application.

This video guide covers the entire process, from starting the Python Flask server using `python3 app.py`, to initiating the React frontend server with `npm start`. It also provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to enter a paragraph for summarization, showcasing the various summaries generated by our algorithms as well as the 'golden summary' crafted by ChatGPT.
