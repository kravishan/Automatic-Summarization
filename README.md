# Project 29: Automatic Summarization 2

This repository contains a React web app and a Python server for creating a summarizer. It also includes a large number of summarization methods. The file `Answers.ipynb` is our Google Colab document that contains answers to all questions up to question number 8. We have developed a web app to showcase the solution to question number 9.

## Demonstration Video

For a comprehensive demonstration of the application setup and usage, watch our demo video on YouTube: [App Demo Video](https://youtu.be/bewVOYbnSx4)

This video guide covers the entire process, from starting the Python Flask server using `python3 app.py`, to initiating the React frontend server with `npm start`. It also provides a step-by-step walkthrough on how to enter a paragraph for summarization, showcasing the various summaries generated by our algorithms as well as the 'golden summary' crafted by ChatGPT.
