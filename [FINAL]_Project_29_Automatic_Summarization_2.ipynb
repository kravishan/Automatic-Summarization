        "In the current scenario, it is necessary to understand blockchain and its value for the effective implementation of Industry 4.0. Some fields have prospective advantages for blockchain, like financial transactions applications in which blockchains can provide trust. Foreign currencies and fiat currency problems are excluded, and a controlled supply transaction may take place. The product itself and its assembly's identification part can also be linked to other areas of Blockchain in Industry 4.0. It provides a reminder where the ability to recognise goods with the defect may be beneficial. Here, blockchain will protect all the details about a product: its sub-assemblies, parts, sales paths, etc. It reduces the expense and interruption of retrieval at any time in the supply chain. New data have been gathered by cameras and sensors that could be used to construct the Blockchains network. It gives us access to more knowledge than a person would gather in a short period [[1], [2], [3]]. In order to maintain end-user support, there must also be a corresponding structural transition within an organisation. Blockchain is one of the most influential technical breakthroughs in various fields [[4], [5]]. This technology is developed remarkably in recent years and provides many applications in manufacturing [6,7]. It is used closely along with terms such as intelligent factories and Industry 4.0. Blockchain refers to a decentralised, encrypted, distributed ledger for filing computers that allow tamper-proof, real-time logs to be created. In Industry 4.0, several elements are still not well described and not fully understood. This new technology will ensure that the future effects of intelligent manufacturing solutions are amplified. The early sales experiences and the current deployments have been learned a great deal. It provides an inclusive distribution strategy, implementing and incorporating these emerging innovations being promoted and supported as resources to meet broader business goals. It could help SMEs (small and medium enterprises), in particular, to defend their inventions since blockchain may make the patent environment more straightforward, transparent and less intermediary. This would encourage competition between companies which has more difficulty in accessing the world of patents. It will allow individuals to generate green energy from a freely negotiated arrangement [[8], [9], [10]]. This technology is exceptional and avoids transactions intermediaries, potentially providing an efficient and cost-effective flow of goods and services. This record is connected to the previous block and cannot be changed or altered in the future. An open, participatory space where anyone can read and write transactions, known as non-authorised, is a decentralised forum. In comparison, blockchain is built for particular users with the advantage of reading and writing to an enclosed network. It is the main difference in the position of consumers and incentives to interact with the system among a private and a public blockchain. The supply chain is a dynamic structure comprising multiple businesses that work together to satisfy customers' needs by adding value from the raw material level to the final product. The main chain is supported by the secondary and tertiary chains that co-operate to form an ecosystem, the supplies chain network [11,12]. Transactions and information transactions also create the complexity of the chain are required to balance. It is essential to believe that blockchain provides continuity and traceability across the supply chain. This paper aims to study the significant potential role of Blockchain for Industry 4.0. This article addresses the following research questions: RQ1: To study major benefits of blockchain in the context of Industry 4.0; RQ2: To identify and study major drivers & enablers of Blockchain technology for industry 4.0; RQ3: To study associated blockchain capabilities for successful Industry 4.0 implementation perspectives; RQ4: To study different Industry 4.0 spheres/sub-domains for Blockchain technology realisation; RQ5: To identify and study major applications of Blockchain technology for Industry 4.0. 1.1. Need for the study In Industry 4.0 environment, real-time information is needed to create a smooth manufacturing and service system. The limiting factor is processing time, so proper consideration for real-world applications is needed. To maintain record and information, blockchain is the perfect technology which can fulfil major challenges. So, the need of this study is to identify the potential role of Blockchain in Industry 4.0. In business, it is time for blockchain replenishment to increase transaction efficiency. Blockchain-empowered sustainable manufacturing in the industries helps for product lifecycle management in Industry 4.0. This technology-enhanced smart factory and has the potential to serve information security [8,13]. In manufacturing environments where risks are lesser, this will flourish and provide a better safety level to processes. However, substantial work must be performed with the platform before the organisations accept blockchain for implementation. The risk level can be minimised, and since the technology is continuously evolving, organisational executives must recognise the beneficial impact of this technology on their enterprise. Industry 4.0 involves an improved degree of faith and privacy. Some blockchain studies related to Industry 4.0 are also available but they are focusing on the specific aspect of the industry 4.0. For instance, Leng et al. [14] have conducted a review to discuss how blockchain can overcome potential cybersecurity barriers to achieving intelligence in Industry 4.0. In this study we have focused on various drivers, enablers, and associated capabilities of Blockchain technology for Industry 4.0 that are holistic in nature. Here blockchain comes in to satisfy the industry-specific requirements of Industry 4.0 [15,16]. 1.2. Blockchain Blockchain can be defined as a decentralised, distributed directory driving smart contracts and providing the opportunity to traceability aid, record management, automation for the supply chain, payment applications and other business transactions. Blockchain provides a record of almost real-time replicated between a network of business partners and is unchanging. The process takes information that would have previously been stored in the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) of the company. It now makes it available in a distributed network of records across disparate companies. Several benefits of blockchain enable organisations to better understand their customers, particularly on the demand side. Data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have well-understood cases of application. It can also reach a glass ceiling when it comes to technological viability, but several businesses strive for convenience. It improves the protection and efficiency of procedures and requires more stamina and resilience than accelerated financial consequences [17,18]. In technology circles, the blockchain is used as a permanent distributed directory to record all value transactions. The organisation has total ownership of the blockchain, other than the nodes that make it superior to other data storage technologies. Each node participating in the transaction would have access to the ledger from multiple devices. This enables decentralisation and network-wide autonomy to build trust and confidence in the transaction ecosystem. Participants initially review all transactions connected to the blockchain. Blockchain technology, sometimes known as distributed ledger technology, is a relatively new form of a database for transaction information stored in a decentralised and transparent manner. The database is run by a network of computers called nodes, so there is no single-point-of-failure, and information can be accessed in real-time. The industry is correctly in line with the concept of the influence on the market of blockchain technologies [12,19,20]. It allows users to preserve their exclusive and unchanging identity documents without their permission that nobody can read or view.\n",

It is the main difference in the position of consumers and incentives to interact with the system among a private and a public blockchain. The supply chain is a dynamic structure comprising multiple businesses that work together to satisfy customers' needs by adding value from the raw material level to the final product. The main chain is supported by the secondary and tertiary chains that co-operate to form an ecosystem, the supplies chain network [11,12]. This article addresses the following research questions: RQ1: To study major benefits of blockchain in the context of Industry 4.0; RQ2: To identify and study major drivers & enablers of Blockchain technology for industry 4.0; RQ3: To study associated blockchain capabilities for successful Industry 4.0 implementation perspectives; RQ4: To study different Industry 4.0 spheres/sub-domains for Blockchain technology realisation; RQ5: To identify and study major applications of Blockchain technology for Industry 4.0. So, the need of this study is to identify the potential role of Blockchain in Industry 4.0.

            "| Filippi et al. [13] made a point that blockchain-based systems are intended to create trust in a particular system, not by entirely removing trust, but rather by maximising the degree of confidence between participants as a means of indirectly reducing the need for trust. This confidence or trust can be achieved more readily because of technical arrangements, particularly open-source software which indicates that to the extent, the code of a specific piece of software can be open, the possible outcome can be more readily predicted theoretically. As a result, this assures participants that the network will produce a certain amount of new Bitcoins (12.5 bitcoins) at a particular speed (one block per 10 ​min) when a miner wins in Proof of Work (PoW) without relying on any financial institution or a centralized authority. Miglani et al. [30] surveyed recent state-of-the-art works on blockchain technology in the context of the Internet of Energy (IoE) to provide readers with a broad insight into future potential and applications of blockchain in IoE sector. Our contributions in the article are presented below: (1) Description of different components of blockchain technologies such as transactions, digital signature, block, consensus mechanisms, and blockchain types with their advantages and limitations when applied in the IoT domain. Analysis of the literature with respect to the following attributes: a) the type of blockchain to be utilized, b) the consensus mechanism to be applied, c) has an access control mechanism been implemented, d) is scalability addressed, e) is the storage method on-chain or off-chain, f) what tools or simulators are utilized, g) what major contributions/outcomes are advanced and h) limitations/remarks. Sections 2.1 Basics of blockchain technology, 2.2 Description of the blockchain technologies, 2.3 Objectives of blockchain technology in IoT, 2.4 Technical limitations of blockchain, and 2.4 provide an overview of blockchain’s fundamental components, the description of blockchain technology, the objectives and the limitations of this technology in IoT applications respectively.

            "| Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted huge interest from academics, researchers, and entrepreneurs thanks to its capacity to offer innovative services across various applications [[1], [2], [3]]. IoT seamlessly interconnects heterogeneous devices and objects to create a physical network in which sensing, processing, and communication processes are automatically controlled and managed without human intervention [4]. With the advent of smart homes, smart cities and other intelligent things, IoT has become a field of immense influence, opportunities and development with the anticipation of more than 50 billion connected devices by 2020 [5]. Different network technologies, including Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Machine-to-Machine (M2M) or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have been developed as indispensable elements for the broader term IoT in the literature. Consequently, security concerns relating to WSN, M2M, or CPS arise in IoT with the standard IP network protocol that requires protection for the entire network framework against security attacks. Otherwise, malicious attacks can obstruct IoT services as well as endanger the data security, users’ privacy and confidentiality of the entire network. Further, blockchain technology has evolved as an important remedy for eliminating trust in conventional authorities or more broadly, online intermediaries, as blockchain supposedly removes the need for trust amongst entities. Alladi et al. [32] summarized major applications of blockchain in smart grids with its important technical details, and prospects of commercial implementation. Analysis of the literature with respect to the following attributes: a) the type of blockchain to be utilized, b) the consensus mechanism to be applied, c) has an access control mechanism been implemented, d) is scalability addressed, e) is the storage method on-chain or off-chain, f) what tools or simulators are utilized, g) what major contributions/outcomes are advanced and h) limitations/remarks.

            "It is the blockchain technology to provide integrity and availability that allows participants in the blockchain network to write, read, and verify transactions recorded in a distributed ledger. However, it does not allow the deletion and modification operations on the transactions and other information stored on its ledger. Further, as a distributed network, to allow the entire set of participants to agree on a unified record, the blockchain technology also needs a consensus protocol, which is essentially a set of rules to be followed by every participant, in order to achieve a globally unified view. In a trustless environment, blockchain provides users with desirable features of decentralization, autonomy, integrity, immutability, verification, fault-tolerance, attracted great academic and industrial attention in the recent few years, anonymity, auditability, and transparency [[1], [2], [3]]. To help and benefit someone to understand the blockchain technology and blockchain security issues, especially for users who use blockchain to do the transactions, and for researchers who will be developing blockchain technology and addressing blockchain security issues, we put in our effort and time to conduct the comprehensive survey and analysis on blockchain technology and its security issues. First, we identify keywords, namely, blockchain, survey, consensus algorithm, smart contract, risk, and blockchain security to search publications and information on the Internet. Second, we survey papers related to blockchain published in top security conferences and journals, e.g., USENIX Security Symposium, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, IEEE Transactions journals, and so on. The main contributions of our survey include: 1) We compare various consensus algorithms with detailed analysis and numerical figures and present the cryptography fundamentals of blockchain; 2) We present the rich information about the smart contract and its security; 3) We explore the widely used applications of blockchain technology, including but not limited to different cryptocurrencies; 4) We conduct a comprehensive analysis on the security risks, real attacks, bugs, root causes, and recent security measures on blockchain itself; Last but not least, 5) The challenges and research trends are summarized and presented in this paper for the further efforts to develop the blockchain technology for the massive deployments. Section 3 describes the blockchain technology in detail, including consensus algorithms, smart contracts, and cryptography for blockchain, while the comprehensive blockchain applications are presented in Section 4. The security risks and real attacks on blockchain are presented in Section 5, and security measures are described in Section 6.\n",
